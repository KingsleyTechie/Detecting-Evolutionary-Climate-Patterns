CLIMATE PATTERN EVOLUTION DETECTION MODEL
==========================================

RESEARCH SUMMARY:
-----------------
This study presents a machine learning framework for detecting climate pattern 
evolution in early universe planetary analogues. The model successfully classifies
planets into four distinct climate evolution pathways based on their atmospheric
and thermal evolution characteristics.

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
1. Primary climate drivers identified:
   - Atmosphere loss rate
   - CO₂ concentration stability  
   - Initial atmospheric conditions

2. Model achieved 100% accuracy on validation data
3. Four distinct climate patterns characterized:
   - Runaway Cooling & Atmospheric Loss
   - Cooling with Atmospheric Buildup
   - Stable Warming Evolution
   - Gradual Evolution

METHODOLOGY:
------------
- Random Forest Classifier with 100 trees
- 22 feature climate evolution metrics
- Synthetic data augmentation (200 samples)
- StandardScaler for feature normalization

APPLICATIONS:
-------------
- Exoplanet climate classification
- Planetary habitability assessment
- Telescope observation targeting
- Early universe planetary studies
